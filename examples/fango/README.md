The ZIP file contains an example of a 2D model built under Lekan, as inflow the model uses different sources :

* a real time flow coming from a remote server
* runoff hydrographs calculated in Lekan from gridded precipitation (from radar and from a forecast model).

You have to change the current hydraulic scheme to go from a configuration to another one.

Results are not present, you have to run the simulation to vizualize them.

**WARNING**: Before opening the Lekan project (file fango.lkn), you have to open the rainfall file "./precipitation/lekan.rrf" with the <a href="https://github.com/vcloarec/ReosProject/wiki/Rainfall-manager"> rainfall manager </a>, and also the runoff "./runoff/runoff.rro" file with the <a href="https://github.com/vcloarec/ReosProject/wiki/Watershed#runoff-manager" >runoff manager</a>).

If you have already rainfall data or runoff model in Lekan, don't forget to note where are your currents files before opening those provided here, to be able to retrieve them later.

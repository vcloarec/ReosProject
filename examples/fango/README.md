The ZIP files contains a example of a 2D models build under Lekan, using :

* a real time flow coming from a remote server
* runoff hydrographs calculated in Lekan from gridded precipitation (from radar and from a forecast model).

Results are not present, you have to run the simulation to vizualize them.

Before opening the Lekan project (file fango.lkn), you have to open the rainfall file "./precipitation/lekan.rrf" with the <a href="https://github.com/vcloarec/ReosProject/wiki/Rainfall-manager"> rainfall manager </a>, and also the runoff "./runoff/runoff.rro" file with the <a href="https://github.com/vcloarec/ReosProject/wiki/Watershed#runoff-manager" >runeoff manager</a>).

If you have already rainfall data or runoff model in Lekan, don't forget to note where are your currents files before opening those provided here, to be able to retrieve them later.

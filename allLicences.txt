51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

LizardTech Computer Software License Agreement for MrSID Decode SDKs revised 8 February 2010 

THIS COMPUTER SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) is entered into by and between CELARTEM, INC., an Oregon corporation doing business as LIZARDTECH, with a principal business address at 1800 SW First Ave, Suite 500, Portland, OR 97201 (“LIZARDTECH”), and a corporation with a principal business address at , Tel. No: , Fax No: (“LICENSEE”). The Agreement is effective (“Effective Date”) as of the date executed by the later party to execute. 
RECITALS 
LIZARDTECH is party to a Technology Licensing Agreement with THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (“UNIVERSITY”) through which it has an exclusive right to commercialize technology for storage and retrieval of large digital images, originally developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (“LANL”), including all patent rights arising under U.S. Patent No. 5,710,835 (“Storage and Retrieval of Large Digital Images”) and certain foreign patents pending (“TECHNOLOGY”). The U.S. Government and UNIVERSITY have certain reserved rights in the TECHNOLOGY as set forth in Appendix A of this Agreement. 
LIZARDTECH is engaged in the business of designing, developing, and marketing MrSID Decode SDKs (including the GeoExpress Decode SDK and the LiDAR Compressor SDK), computer software and related products arising from or developed based on the TECHNOLOGY (“DSDK”). DSDK consists of libraries that allow licensees to write software, or engineer a process, that enables end-users to view MrSID-formatted files and other supported file types. 
LICENSEE desires to design, develop or market software products that use DSDK to permit (among other functionality developed by LICENSEE) an end-user to view *. sid-formatted files and other supported formatted files (“Licensed Products”). 
In consideration of the premises and mutual covenants of this Agreement, LIZARDTECH agrees to license DSDK to LICENSEE for LICENSEE’s use in the development of Licensed Products, and LICENSEE’s subsequent sublicensing of DSDK with the Licensed Products pursuant to the terms and conditions which follow. 
1. LICENSE GRANT 
1.1 DSDK. In addition to the patent rights described above, DSDK and any and all associated media, printed materials, and “online” or electronic documentation provided with DSDK are protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties, and is licensed, not sold. LICENSEE shall not modify, reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile or otherwise seek to discover the source code or trade secrets of DSDK. LICENSEE shall not use DSDK to develop products or allow others to develop products that encode files into the MrSID format.
1.2 Development License Grant. LIZARDTECH hereby grants to LICENSEE a nonexclusive license to install DSDK on a reasonable number of CPUs in LICENSEE’s own facilities only for its own internal use and development of Licensed Products that use DSDK to view *.sid files. 
1.3 Distribution License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, LIZARDTECH hereby grants to LICENSEE a nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable right to distribute DSDK in object code format with the Licensed Products. For avoidance of ambiguity, LICENSEE is not permitted to distribute DSDK source code libraries. LICENSEE may distribute DSDK with the Licensed Products to sublicensees (and such sublicensees may further sublicense DSDK with the Licensed Products to other sublicensees) provided: 
(a) a notice regarding LIZARDTECH or its licensors’ ownership rights shall be provided with the Licensed Products as set forth in Subsection 2.2 below; 
(b) DSDK shall only be sublicensed under license terms as set forth in Subsection 1.3(d) below and any and all distribution of DSDK with the Licensed Product does not cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, DSDK to become subject to the terms of any Open Source license, including but not limited to the GNU Public License; 
(c) any and all distribution of DSDK shall not (i) create, or purport to create, any obligations for LIZARDTECH or its licensors with respect to DSDK; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under LIZARDTECH or its licensors’ intellectual property or proprietary rights in DSDK; 
(d) DSDK shall be sublicensed to any and all sublicensees subject to a license agreement that provides LIZARDTECH and its licensors with the same protections and requirements as set forth in Sections 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 2, 3, 4, 6.1 and Appendix A. For the avoidance of ambiguity, LICENSEE and any and all sublicensees may not sublicense DSDK separately from the Licensed Products. 
1.4 Rights in DSDK. LIZARDTECH and its licensors retain all right, title to, and ownership of all applicable intellectual property rights such as patent, copyrights and trade secrets in DSDK (including Updates as defined in Section 2.3) and any associated documentation. Without limiting its rights in any way, LIZARDTECH hereby specifically reserves the worldwide nonexclusive right to develop, use, reproduce and distribute DSDK directly to other integrators, distributors and/or end-users. DSDK, including features and related information, are unpublished software, trade secret, confidential or proprietary information of LIZARDTECH or its licensors. DSDK is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of DSDK by the U. S. government shall be solely in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Except as expressly permitted pursuant to Section 1.3, LICENSEE shall not rent, sell, lease, disclose or otherwise provide DSDK, associated documentation or any related information to any third party and will use such efforts, and in no event less than a commercially reasonable effort, to protect DSDK, associated documentation or related information as LICENSEE uses to protect its own trade secret, confidential or proprietary information. 
2. OBLIGATIONS OF LICENSEE 
2.1 Trademark Usage. LIZARDTECH grants to LICENSEE a nonexclusive, nontransferable limited license to use and display LIZARDTECH’s trademarks, logos or other elements of its branding (collectively “Trademarks”) in connection with LICENSEE’S license rights granted hereunder with respect to DSDK, provided, however, such use shall be subject to the terms in the Trademarks: Limited License provision located in the Terms of Use at www.lizardtech.com. LICENSEE agrees to abide by such terms and LICENSEE further agrees to monitor the above referenced Trademarks: Limited License provision for any updates or amendments to such terms. 
2.2 Proprietary Rights Notice. LICENSEE must include in all Licensed Products all ownership/copyright, Trademark, trade secret and other intellectual or proprietary rights notices accompanying the Licensed Products in the About Box for all Licensed Products, or any other similar location where LICENSEE
places proprietary rights notices pertaining to third-party software incorporated in the Licensed Products. At a minimum, LICENSEE shall include the following notice in all Licensed Products:

LICENSEE agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to implement Updates provided by LIZARDTECH into the next scheduled release of the Licensed Products. LIZARDTECH may, but is not obligated to, provide such Updates to DSDK. Updates shall mean maintenance revisions that correct identified errors in, or provide bug fixes for DSDK and may also include support for additional file formats. 
3. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. LIZARDTECH AND ITS LICENSORS PROVIDE DSDK “AS IS” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. LIZARDTECH, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER RELATING TO THE DSDK, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY (IF ANY) IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF REASONABLE CARE OR WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, OF RESULTS, OF LACK OF NEGLIGENCE, OR OF A LACK OF VIRUSES, ALL WITH REGARD TO DSDK. THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUIET POSSESSION, CORRESPONDENCE TO DESCRIPTION, AUTHORITY, OR NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO DSDK. 
4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL LIZARDTECH OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, WHETHER RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS, DATA, USE OR REVENUE, OR FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. This limitation of liability shall apply regardless of the form of action whether in contract or in tort, including by negligence or any other basis. 
5. TERM AND TERMINATION 
5.1 Term and Termination. The initial term of this Agreement will commence as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party if the other party is in material breach of any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within the thirty (30) day period. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon the delivery of thirty (30) days prior written notice of termination to the other party. 
5.2 Obligations Upon Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, all licenses granted to LICENSEE shall terminate and LICENSEE must return to LIZARDTECH or destroy all copies of DSDK in its possession, custody, or control, whether modified or not. In the event this Agreement is terminated without cause, LICENSEE may (a) retain a reasonable number of copies of Licensed Products, not to exceed five (5) copies, for purposes of its internal use solely to facilitate customer support for existing customers only; and (b) exhaust its current stock of Licensed Products over a period of no more than thirty (30) days after the date of termination.

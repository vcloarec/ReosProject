typedef struct {

	/*
	  This struct may hold a simple text string,
	  a text list, or a text table.

	  A text string goes into array textString, null terminated with
	  numberTextChars characters set to number (including null)
	  with the C part being the name e.g., "/Color/" for below

	  For a text table, this follows essentially the conventions of paired data
	  The first column is the ordinate or independent value,
	  the second and subsequent columns are dependent values.
	  As a example, we might have a list of colors and their characteristics:

	  Color		wave length		temperature		Energy
	  Red			long			hot			  low
	  Blue			short			cool		  high
	  Yellow		med-long		warm		  medium

	  The first column contains the ordinates (colors) and is the independent variable
	  The second and subsequent columns are dependent values
	  The top line (header) are lables.
	  textTable = "long\0short\0med-long\0hot\0cool\warm\0low\0high\medium\0"
	  The labels array would be labels = "Color\0wave length\0temperature\0energy\0"
	  Note - as a deviation from paired data, the first label applies to the
	  independent variable (in paired data, the first label applies to the first dependent)
	  The C part of the pathname contians the name of the dependent, a dash, then the
	  name of the independent, eg. "/Colors-Characteristics/"

	  A text list is just the ordinate (first) column with the C part being the name "/Colors/"
